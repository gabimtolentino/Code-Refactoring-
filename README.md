# Code-Refactoring-
My first challenge HW 1
This is my first project challenge! I have been tasked to refactor existing code.
My first step was to view and analyze the semantic HTML elements.
Once I viewed the existing HTML structure I looked for repition that I could potentially organize in a more structured manner.
I put to use the semantic HTML information that I learned in class.
I made sure to commit and push frequently to my GitHub.
I added CSS comments.
I added accessible alt attributes to the existing image elements.
Eveything including the heading elements were made to be in sequential order.
I made sure to replace any exisitng titles with something more descriptive.
